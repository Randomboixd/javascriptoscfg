# Javascript OS Config

*"I want to have my operating system image created by typescript!" - Said no one*

## Purpose of this project

You found this repo! Well it's name explains what this thing does fairly well, but here is exactly what this does:

This project is for creating declarative `rpm-ostree` system images using typescript instead of having to manually write recipe files, yaml, or containerfiles yourself!

I made this project as an alternative to blue-build since i don't like yaml. Now at this point you might be saying: "Why don't just use NixOS?". But i did. i did use nix, but i'd still like to be closer to a fedora install. since gnome seems to work better there.

Also since you're writing typescript, you could do things that yaml can't. Like send network requests to get a zip file and write it to disk... All while avoiding that thing we call `/usr/bin/bash`.

Also this uses bun btw.

## Licenses and things.
This project is primarily licensed under the MIT License. Portions of this codebase are derived from the ublue-os/ubuntu repository, which is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. For more information, see the `LICENSE` and `LICENSE-APACHE` files.

I am not really good at licenses though, as i am not a lawyer. if i did something wrong, make a pull request.

Here is what i changed:
1. **Changing names**:
   - Original: `push-ghcr`
   - Updated to: `makeContainers`
   - Reason: Reflects the expanded scope of the job.

2. **Scheduled Time**:
   - Original: `cron: "20 03 * * *"`
   - Updated to: `cron: "00 06 * * *"`
   - Reason: Apparently this is 20minutes after ublue images are built.

3. **Additional dependencies and things.**:
   - Added steps to install `bun` and project dependencies.

4. **Metadata changes**:
   - Removed static metadata labels in favor of dynamic values generated from `Examine-(value).ts` files.

If you want to see the EXACT changes. I invite you to look at the `.github/workflows/build-images.yml` file. I marked EVERY modification there. Or atleast i hope i got all.

Remember i am **NOT** a lawyer, and my knowledge in licenses is basically: "oooh mit license. wow. why not" and i am certain that i missed a little detail. Please make an issue or pull request if i did.

## Getting started

### Getting the repository.
This project is a template. You can literally get started by clicking "Use this template". Then you can create either a **private** or a **public** repository. Each has their own advantages and disadvantages. Let me list them.

**A Private Repository:**
- Requires you to make the built containers public so `rpm-ostree` can grab it. You can do so by going to *Packages > (Image name) > Package settings > Danger Zone > Change package visibility*
- Uses your account's actions quota. (*You have 2000 minutes on a free account which is roughly 13 days of build time.*)
    
    - If you are **worried** about this project using up all your quota remember these things:
        
        - This doesn't apply if your repository is **public**. Actions is **free for all** on **public** repos.

        - Each build takes around 3 minutes. But this varies depending on how many packages/files you add.

        - This project has a cron job to rebuild the image every day at **06:00 UTC**. A month has around **30 days**. Lets say our build takes **3 minutes**. If everything is right that means we use only around **90 minutes** of your precious Actions time... Of course **this varies** from amount of packages. As i said.

**A public repository:**
- Your images can be seen by **anyone** on github.
- Not only can they see it, but they can **rebase** to it.
- Actions time is **free**! Yay!

Your choice on which option you pick. I recommend going with public!

### Setting up signing

By default your containers **AREN'T** signed!

And just to scare you into signing your containers, the first Google result literally says if you don't sign a container... **you're in for a bad time**.

Let's just say we have joe. They rebase to your image, thinking it's completely legit. then KA

![A gif of a bomb from Keep talking and nobody explodes? I think](https://media1.tenor.com/m/KEtOFTCtAFsAAAAd/bobm-jumpscare.gif)


[BOOM There goes your system, watch it crumble, feel the power.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7HmGf81y5M) *(sorry)*

During download it was somehow tampered with by **EVIL** joe and he added a layer that actually uninstalls your entire desktop environment and replaces it with DOOM... and likely encrypts your home folder. just in case. and maybe deletes your bootloader. and replaces it with nyan cat.

"It is not so good" - *my classmate who barely knows english*

Terrible example i know. But yeah signing allows us to say nuh uh! and it's actually quite simple to do aswell!

First of all, get cosign. Use your package manager or something. Nix also works (`nix-shell -p cosign`)

Then, type in `cosign generate-key-pair`. now DO NOT set your password! Leave it empty.

Now see that cosign.key? OPEN IT RIGHT NOW AND COPY IT'S CONTENTS THEN DELETE IT IMMIDIATELY!

Now go into your github repository, go to settings, Secrets and variables, Actions, New repository secret, and create a secret called `SIGN`. Paste the contents of that key in there.

Congrats! You just set up signing! Now commit that cosign.pub and let it override mine. That's it! You're now signing containers!

### Declaring a "System"

Now when you created your clone of the template, you got one system in the systems folder, that's called `base.ts`!

It aims to demonstrate what it can do. You can delete that and follow along.

So Systems are an instance of the System class by `joscfg-ostree`. You make a new instance of them, and then apply Derivations on top of it to modify the system.

Let me get into the details.

```ts
import System from "../src/lib/joscfg-ostree/System";


export const system = new System()
   .setChannel("ghcr.io/ublue-os/silverblue-main", "41")
   .setPublishedImageConfig("my-first-image", "Hello, World!")
```

This file **exports** *([Read MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export))* a **constant** system variable *([Read MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const))* called system.

This is then grabbed by the `joscfg-ostree` Builder to make a Containerfile.

Basically, tells the builder that this is a system.

We then use the .setChannel() with the channel that we want to use. 


> [!NOTE]
> A channel in javascript os config is a image that we are building upon. Your IDE Should recommend a few ones, but you are free to base your image on top of anything!

We also use the second parameter to select 41 as the version. This is **COMPLETELY** optional. Just leave it and it will use the absolute latest version.

> [!WARNING]
> If you are going to stick with an older image, remember that Fedora supports releases for approx 13 months. And since they release a new one every 6 months, meaning if you base your release on Fedora 40 for example, you'll get package updates till Fedora 42 and one more month. Keep up with updates if possible. If you don't think you can handle this, use "latest"

Then we configure the **published image configuration**. The first parameter is the **image name**, as it's going to be published on the **GHCR** (Github Container Registry). Then the **description**, which can be mostly anything... just explain your image in a few words. That should do it!

Congratulations! You just created your own imag- oh wait... right we have to add it to our workflows.

In your IDE, find the `.github` folder, and then enter `workflows`. Open that build-images.yml file and look for something like:

```yaml
systems:
   - base.ts
```

Here is where we mention our system. Let's say we named our system's **FILENAME** to `first.ts`, we gotta add first.ts to the array. By creating a new line and adding it like `- first.ts`. Also let's remove `- base.ts` since we don't wanna build a non existent system (Recap: We just deleted it. if you remember)!

> [!CAUTION]
> Identation matters! Especially in YAML! Use tabs. It takes **5** tabs to reach systems and add a new entry!

> [!CAUTION]
> Additionally, Javascript OS Config expects systems to be in systems/ **NO MATTER WHAT.** There is no arguing with the builder! So you don't need to write a large paragraph to the system file. Just enter it's filename and call it a day!

Now we can truly create image! Add both the build-images.yml and system to git, and commit them, then push them.

Now visit github workflows, click the workflow and pray that it builds... if it did...

ðŸŽ‰ **YOU DID IT!** ðŸŽ‰

Now you can rebase to it by running:
```bash
rpm-ostree rebase unverified-ostree-registry:ghcr.io/(Your github username)/(name of your container as defined in setPublishedImageConfig):(the version number you are using for your own image. Since this uses fedora 41, you should use 41)
```
> [!WARNING]
> If your github repository is private, then you must manually set the container package to public for `rpm-ostree` to see it.


You should have a command like this:

```bash
rpm-ostree rebase unverified-ostree-registry:ghcr.io/randomboixd/testimage:40
```

Do so and you may recieve a prompt to enter your password. do so!

and congrats! You are now running your own container... well you will once you restart.

... But we literally just copied fedora silverblue 41... ugh that's not too special.

### Deriving from the base channel using Derivations
